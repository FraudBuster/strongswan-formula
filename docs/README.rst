Meta-state (This is a state that includes other states)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will install the strongswan package only.

``strongswan.config``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will configure the strongswan service and has a dependency on ``strongswan.install``
via include list.

Configuration is splitted:
  * for connections:
  
    * in a main file for default options and `%default` connection. This file include files from 'dropin' directory
    * in a 'dropin' directory where each connection has its own config file
  * for secrets:
  
    * in a main file which include files from 'dropin' directory
    * in a 'dropin' directory where each connection has its own secret file

``strongswan.service``

   $ bundle install
   $ bin/kitchen test [platform]

Where ``[platform]`` is the platform name defined in ``kitchen.yml``,
e.g. ``debian-9-2019-2-py3``.

``bin/kitchen converge``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creates the docker instance and runs the ``template`` main state, ready for testing.

``bin/kitchen verify``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs the ``inspec`` tests on the actual instance.

``bin/kitchen destroy``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Removes the docker instance.

``bin/kitchen test``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs all of the stages above in one go: i.e. ``destroy`` + ``converge`` + ``verify`` + ``destroy``.

``bin/kitchen login``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gives you SSH access to the instance for manual testing.
