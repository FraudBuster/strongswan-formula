# Setup variables using grains['osfinger'] based logic.
# You just need to add the key:values for an `osfinger` that differ
# from `defaults.yaml` + `os_family.yaml` + `osmap.yaml`.
# Only add an `osfinger` which is/will be supported by the formula
# (empty `osfinger`s do not need to be listed, just added here as an example).
